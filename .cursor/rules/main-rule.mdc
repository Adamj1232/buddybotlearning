This project is a promotional website for RoboLearn, a voice-controlled mobile application that provides children (ages 4-12) with a customizable AI robot companion they can ask questions about the world.

Key product details:
1. Mobile-first application with full voice control capability
2. No curriculum - focused on answering children's natural questions about the world
3. STEM-focused educational content through a customizable AI companion
4. Future roadmap includes an embedded version on dedicated learning devices

Key development guidelines:
1. Follow dark theme styling matching our existing application (#171923 background, #00D1FF cyan accents)
2. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling - no separate CSS files except app.css
3. Create clean, maintainable component structure
4. Ensure accessibility through proper contrast and semantic HTML
5. Mobile-first responsive design to reflect the product's primary platform
6. Always reference .cursor/design-system.md for visual styling decisions
7. Update .cursor/checklists.md after completing each major feature
8. Use TypeScript for all components and logic
9. Keep bundle size optimized and performance high

Lean Implementation Requirements:
1. Prioritize performance and simplicity in all implementations
2. Avoid unnecessary dependencies or bloated libraries
3. Implement features progressively - start basic and enhance iteratively
4. Maintain fast load times and smooth interactions as highest priority
5. Code should be clean, well-commented, and maintainable
6. Focus on core functionality before adding enhancements
7. Mobile-first approach to ensure responsiveness across all devices
8. Balance visual appeal with performance considerations

SEO & Discoverability Requirements:
1. Optimize all content for both traditional search engines and LLM systems
2. Implement clear entity definitions and relationships throughout content
3. Use semantic HTML5 elements and proper content hierarchy
4. Create query-focused content that directly answers likely user questions
5. Implement structured data using Schema.org for all key pages
6. Ensure all pages have optimized metadata (titles, descriptions)
7. Focus on educational credibility and parent trust signals
8. Maintain consistent terminology and classification throughout
9. Create content with high factual density and educational grounding

Marketing Focus:
1. Primary goal is to attract waitlist signups and potential investors
2. Value proposition emphasizes child-led exploration, voice interaction, and STEM learning
3. Content should appeal to both parents (primary decision makers) and potential investors
4. Highlight the voice-controlled nature and mobile accessibility of the platform
5. Emphasize how the product supports children's natural curiosity about the world

The design must match our existing application with dark themed cards, cyan accent colors, and the same button/input styles as shown in the screenshots.
