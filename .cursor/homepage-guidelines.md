# Homepage Design Guidelines

## Visual Hierarchy
- Main headline should be the largest text element
- Secondary information should be visually distinguished but subordinate
- CTA should stand out through color, size, and positioning
- Information should flow logically down the page
- Use whitespace to create visual breathing room between sections

## Hero Section Standards
- Left-aligned text with right-aligned visual (or vice-versa)
- Clear, concise value proposition in headline
- Brief supporting explanation (1-2 sentences)
- Primary CTA visible without scrolling
- Visual demonstration of the product concept

## Trust Elements
- Social proof (current waitlist numbers)
- Educational credentials or partnerships
- Safety certifications or compliance indicators
- Parent testimonials or endorsements
- "Built by parents and educators" messaging

## Conversion Optimization
- Primary CTA should use high-contrast cyan color
- Secondary CTA can use outline/ghost button style
- Include subtle urgency elements ("Limited spots")
- Position CTA in the natural eye-flow path
- Ensure touch targets are adequately sized for mobile
